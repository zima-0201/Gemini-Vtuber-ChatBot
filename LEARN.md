Welcome to Vixevia's learning guide! This document aims to provide you, with insights into how Vixevia works and how you can contribute to the project.

### System Architecture

Vixevia utilizes a multi-layered architecture for processing user interactions and generating responses:

**1. Input Layer:**
- **Speech Recognition:** Captures user speech and converts it to text.
- **Vision Processing:** Analyzes images from a webcam using OpenCV and generates descriptive text through the vision model.

**2. Processing Layer:**
- **Gemini Language Model:** The core of Vixevia, powered by Google's Gemini, interprets the combined text input from both speech and vision, understands context, and generates responses.
- **Dialogue Management:** Maintains conversation history and manages the flow of dialogue.

**3. Output Layer:**
- **Text-to-Speech Synthesis:** Converts generated text responses to audio using gTTS and So-VITS-SVC for a more natural-sounding voice.
- **Visual Output:** While currently not implemented, there's potential for displaying Vixevia's expressions or reactions through a virtual avatar.

### Key Components

* **Google Generative AI (Gemini):** Responsible for natural language processing, understanding user queries, and generating contextually relevant responses.
* **SpeechRecognition:** Handles speech-to-text conversion.
* **so-vits-svc-fork:** Provides advanced text-to-speech synthesis with realistic voice generation.
* **PyAudio & simpleaudio:** Facilitate audio input and output functionalities.
* **Torch & Transformers:** Libraries essential for deep learning and natural language processing tasks.
* **gTTS:** Text-to-speech library for basic audio generation.
* **opencv-python:** Enables image processing and computer vision tasks.
* **FastAPI & Uvicorn:** Framework for building the web application and server.

### Contribution Opportunities

* **Live2D Model Integration:** Develop or integrate a Live2D model to provide Vixevia with a visually engaging and expressive avatar.
* **Enhanced Vision Capabilities:** Improve object recognition and scene understanding in the vision processing component. 
* **Multi-language Support:** Extend Vixevia's capabilities to understand and respond in multiple languages.
* **Personality Refinement:** Fine-tune the system prompt and training data to create a more nuanced and engaging personality for Vixevia.
* **Web Interface Development:** Improve the user interface and user experience of the web application.
* **Additional Features:** Explore and implement new features, such as sentiment analysis, emotion detection, and more diverse response formats (e.g., images, videos).
